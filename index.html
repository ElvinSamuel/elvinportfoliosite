    What are you doing over here? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

    Thanks for taking a look at my site! I've been working out a new design, so feel free to look around.
    My methodology as a developer is to maximize simplicity in my designs. This leads to improved code, better
    readability and better communication. Expert communication is, in my opinion, one of the most important
    overlooked skills in our profession, and I've made it my mission to change that. Whether through our code
    to other developers, to our coworkers, or even through our clients, great communication is the basis of
    any successful relationship and company. Again, thank you!
