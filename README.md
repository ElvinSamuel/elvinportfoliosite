## What's This?
Just my portfolio site, with work history, experience, etc. 

## Design
I like to keep things as simple, and focus on the elements that are present on screen. Too much clutter tends to overwhelm me, so I try to avoid it in my designs. The remaining elements get all of the users attention, and I use this to communicate things as clearly.
